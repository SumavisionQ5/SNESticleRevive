# src/nes/

NES emulation subsystem for SNESticle Aurora, based on InfoNES.

SNESticle Aurora is maintained by **itsveenee** and is based on **SNESticle Revive by ReyFxck (Thomas R.)**, with the original SNESticle codebase by **Icer Addis**.

## QuickNES integration

Aurora also integrates **QuickNES**, originally by **Shay Green**, through
the libretro QuickNES codebase.

The Aurora integration is pinned at `src/third_party/quicknes`.
Initialize it with:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

The integration fork is maintained at `itsveenee/QuickNES_Core`.
See the submodule's own license and source-file notices.

This directory contains a copy of [InfoNES](https://github.com/jay-kumogata/InfoNES)

InfoNES is © 2000-2006 InfoNES Project (originally based on pNesX by Jay).

## Why InfoNES

iaddis's original SNESticle source tree (circa 2004) references a parallel
`NESticle/Source/` project that was never publicly released. The Makefile and
mainloop have full integration scaffolding for NES support, gated behind
`#if 0` because the NES core implementation files are missing.

InfoNES was chosen as the NES core because:

- Apache 2.0 license is compatible with this GPLv2 project
- The codebase is small (~5500 LoC) and self-contained
- It already targets multiple platforms including embedded ones (GBA, PSP)
  so porting to PS2 bare-metal is straightforward
- ~85% compatibility covers all canonical commercial NES/Famicom titles
- The code style is close to iaddis's, making integration into SNESticle's
  iaddis-derived mainloop natural

## Status

The InfoNES core is built into the PS2 frontend with video, controller input,
audio, iNES mapper dispatch, battery-backed SRAM and cartridge save states.
NES states include the 6502, PPU, pAPU, CHR RAM, active bank references and the
complete writable mapper-data span. Famicom Disk System execution/state support
is still separate and incomplete.

The five base 2A03 channels are synthesized by Shay Green's cycle-timed
Nes_Snd_Emu and Blip_Buffer directly at the frontend's 32 kHz rate. Register
writes retain their 6502-cycle position, and pulse/envelope/length, triangle,
noise, DPCM and frame-counter state are preserved in cartridge save states.
Mapper expansion audio (VRC6/VRC7/MMC5/FDS/Sunsoft 5B) is not connected yet.
